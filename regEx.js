// Using the Test Method

/*
Regular expressions are used in programming languages to match parts of strings. You create patterns to help you do that matching.

If you want to find the word "the" in the string "The dog chased the cat", you could use the following regular expression: /the/. Notice that quote marks are not required within the regular expression.

JavaScript has multiple ways to use regexes. One way to test a regex is using the .test() method. The .test() method takes the regex, applies it to a string (which is placed inside the parentheses), and returns true or false if your pattern finds something or not.

let testStr = "freeCodeCamp";
let testRegex = /Code/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
// Returns true

Apply the regex myRegex on the string myString using the .test() method.
*/

let myString = "Hello, World!";
let myRegex = /Hello/;
let result = myRegex.test(myString); // Change this line

// Match Literal Strings
/*
In the last challenge, you searched for the word "Hello" using the regular expression /Hello/. That regex searched for a literal match of the string "Hello". Here's another example searching for a literal match of the string "Kevin":

let testStr = "Hello, my name is Kevin.";
let testRegex = /Kevin/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
// Returns true
Any other forms of "Kevin" will not match. For example, the regex /Kevin/ will not match "kevin" or "KEVIN".

let wrongRegex = /kevin/;
wrongRegex.test(testStr);
// Returns false
A future challenge will show how to match those other forms as well.


Complete the regex waldoRegex to find "Waldo" in the string waldoIsHiding with a literal match.
*/

let waldoIsHiding = "Somewhere Waldo is hiding in this text.";
let waldoRegex = /Waldo/; // Change this line
let result = waldoRegex.test(waldoIsHiding);
